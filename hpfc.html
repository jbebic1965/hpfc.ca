<h2 class="jb1">The Hybrid Power Flow Controller</h2>
<p class="jb1">The Hybrid Power Flow Controller uses two equally rated 
voltage-sourced converters to upgrade the functionality of the existing switched 
capacitors or static VAR compensators (SVCs). Since static converters are used together 
with passive devices, the power flow controller can be considered <em>hybrid</em> 
and it is therefore named a "Symmetrical Hybrid Power Flow Controller" (HPFC). 
</p>
<p class="jb1">The work in my thesis <a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a> demonstrates 
that by using appropriate converter control the functionality of switched capacitors and SVCs can be 
changed from reactive power support to the generalized power flow control &ndash; the functionality 
commonly associated with the UPFC. The key benefit of the new topology is that it fully utilizes 
existing equipment and thereby the required ratings of the additional converters are substantially 
lower than the ratings of the comparable UPFC.

1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed Topology
</h2>
<p class="jb1">A block diagrammatic view of a typical HPFC application is shown in 
Fig.&nbsp;1. 
The HPFC is installed at some point along the transmission line connecting two 
electrical regions characterized by their The'venin's equivalent voltage 
sources <em>V</em><sub>S</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>R</sub>. The line is thereby 
divided into two segments represented by the equivalent reactances X<sub>S</sub> 
and X<sub>R</sub>. Indices &quot;S&quot; and &quot;R&quot; identify &quot;sending&quot; 
and &quot;receiving&quot; end/segment of the line.
<!--
The HPFC is installed on a transmission line that connects two electrical 
areas. The particular point of installation will often be dictated by the location of 
existing equipment, and in general it will be "within" the transmission line, i.e., 
at some distance from strong voltage buses.

<p class="jb1">Central to the HPFC's topology is the shunt connected source of 
reactive power &ndash; shown as the variable capacitance in Fig.&nbsp;1.
Next, there are two voltage&ndash;sourced converters (VSCs) connected to the associated line
segments in series using coupling transformers. The converters share a common DC
circuit, coupling each other's DC terminals. 
</p>
<p class="jb1">By controlling the magnitudes and angles 
of voltages supplied by the converters, the flow of active power through the line and 
the amounts of reactive power supplied to the corresponding line segments can be 
simultaneously and independently controlled. The control of the shunt device is 
coordinated with the control of converters to supply the bulk of the total required 
reactive power.

2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent Circuit and Operating Constraints
</h2>
<p class="jb1">A simplified single phase equivalent circuit &ndash; including the HPFC, the 
interconnected electrical regions, and the corresponding line segments &ndash; is shown in 
Fig.&nbsp;2(a). 
</p>
      <p class="jb1"> The variable capacitance, labeled BM<sub></sub>, represents 
        the controllable shunt connected variable susceptance. The range of values 
        this parameter can assume depends on the installed power components; in 
        general case it can be positive (capacitive), zero, or negative (inductive). 
      </p>
<p class="jb1">
Voltage sources <em>V</em><sub>X</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>Y</sub> represent the high voltage 
equivalents of voltages generated by the VSCs. The common DC circuit of the VSCs is represented 
by the capacitor C<sub>DC</sub>, and this capacitor is charged or discharged based on the 
difference of active powers coupled by the converters.

This circuit is subject to many constraints &ndash; and we summarized them in 
Fig.&nbsp;2(b). 
</p>
<p class="jb1">
First, converters' voltage ratings impose magnitude limits on 
<em>V</em><sub>X</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>Y</sub>. 
Additionally, magnitudes of <em>I</em><sub>S</sub> and <em>I</em><sub>R</sub> are limited, 
as these currents flow through the converters' switches.

Then, line insulation requires that magnitudes 
of voltages <em>V</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>2</sub> are limited, and voltage ratings of 
the shunt susceptance require limited magnitude of <em>V</em><sub>M</sub>. 
And finally, in order to operate the converters, we require that <em>V</em><sub>DC</sub> is 
maintained at a steady value, so in steady state <em>P</em><sub>X</sub> has to be equal 
<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub>.

3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Glance at the Big Picture</h2>

<p class="jb1">Before we get too deep into the analysis, let us sum up what we have 
this far... We introduced the new topology and represented it with a reasonably simple 
equivalent circuit. Furthermore, we identified and explained the constraints applicable 
to this circuit. 
</p> 

<p class="jb1"> 
So, things are beginning to look quite technical &ndash; and we fear that we may start to loose 
some of the audience. To postpone that, let us take a quick look at the big picture, 
and explain what we are setting out to do... </p>

<p class="jb1"> We are proposing to install 
this <em>fancy new HPFC device</em> on a transmission line, and use it to control the flow 
of power through the line. So, to sell these things, we will have to approach someone 
that owns a transmission line (or runs a transmission system) and say: <em>Look, 
you install such and such equipment, and you achieve such and such range of 
control for power flow... The equipment will cost you some money, but you 
will get this wonderful flexibility to run your line harder, transfer more power, 
and make more money. </em> 
</p> 

<p class="jb1"> The conclusion? To sell these things, we have to be able to quantify 
the benefits they provide, i.e., we have to be able to compute the range of 
achievable power transfer given the line parameters and the proposed equipment 
ratings.
<!--
In simple terms - 
there has to be a mapping from investment dollars to a quantifiable benefit, or else 
there will be no sales. 
-->
</p>

<p class="jb1"> Ok! We are now ready to return to the technical discussion...</p>

<p class="jb1"><a class="jbjmp" href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<h2 class="jb1"><a name="h-4" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady State Operation
</h2>

<p class="jb1"> Our ultimate objective is now clear &ndash; solve the range of power transfer 
given the line parameters and the converters' ratings. For starters, however, let us discuss a 
smaller problem &ndash; solving for one "viable" operating point. Following is the problem statement 
in technical terms...
</p>

<p class="jb1"> We seek to find voltage vectors 
<strong>V</strong><sub>X</sub> and <strong>V</strong><sub>Y</sub> and a value 
for scalar variable <em>B</em><sub>M</sub>, such that a specified amount of 
power (<em>P</em><sub>ref</sub>) is transferred through the line and that the resulting 
operating point satisfies all constraints listed in Fig.&nbsp;2(b). 
We will refer to such solution as to a "viable" steady state operating point resulting 
in power transfer <em>P</em>=<em>P</em><sub>ref</sub>. The operating point is "viable" 
if and only if it satisfies the constraints of Fig.&nbsp;2(b).
</p>

<!--
The power 
flow controller enables transfer of a specified amount of power (e.g. P2) through
the controlled transmission line. Of course, transferring the specified amount of active power
through the line stipulates that the reactive powers supplied to the sending and receiving
segments of the line (Q1 and Q2) are within certain limits. The particular choice of Q1
and Q2 depends on the parameters of the line and on the given system conditions (i.e.
magnitudes of VS and VR and their relative angle). In general, the reference values for P2,
Q1, and Q2 are obtained from a load flow study.

The viable operating points could be obtained using iterative numerical techniques. A
traditional approach is to express the desired output quantities (i.e., P2, Q1, and Q2) and
variables subject to constraints (i.e., PX-PY, IS, IR, jV1j, jV2j, and jVMj) as functions
of control variables (VX, DX, VY, DY, BM); and then, to use numerical iterations to achieve
the desired solution. It can be observed that five control variables are at disposal to solve
a system of four nonlinear equations, (i.e., P2 = P2ref , Q1 = Q1ref , Q2 = Q2ref , and
PX - PY = 0). The existence of an additional degree of freedom gives rise to a notion of
optimization, and qualifies the problem of selecting viable operating points into the class of
problems of nonlinear constrained optimization. 
-->

<p class="jb1"> Let us look at this problem more closely... A scholarly approach to solving 
these sorts of problems is to express the desired output quantities (i.e., <em>P</em>) 
and variables subject to constraints (i.e., 
<em>P</em><sub>X</sub>&minus;<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub>, 
|<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub>|, |<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>|, 
|<strong>V</strong><sub>1</sub>|, |<strong>V</strong><sub>2</sub>|, and 
|<strong>V</strong><sub>M</sub>|) as functions of control variables 
(<strong>V</strong><sub>X</sub>, <strong>V</strong><sub>Y</sub>, <em>B</em><sub>M</sub>); 
and then, to use numerical iterations to achieve the desired solution. It can be observed 
that five control variables (two vectors and one scalar) are at disposal to solve a system 
of two nonlinear equations, (<em>P</em>=<em>P</em><sub>ref</sub>, and 
<em>P</em><sub>X</sub>&minus;<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub>=0). The existence of additional degrees of 
freedom gives rise to a notion of optimization, and qualifies the problem of selecting 
viable operating points into the class of problems of nonlinear constrained optimization.
</p>

<!--
<p class="jb1"> Well, now we know we are in trouble! For those not informed - there is 
no known method that can guarantee a solution of global optimum for this class of problems. 
And, what's more important, if we can't find one solution, we can certainly kiss goodbye 
our ultimate objective of finding the range of power transfer.
</p>
-->
<p class="jb1"> Well, you say, this does not look good anymore! </p>
<p class="jb1"> I now have to iterate to find each solution; 
then &ndash; when I find it &ndash; it may or may not be a global optimum, and I don't know how to check 
if it is. And &ndash; to top it all off &ndash; we are talking about one solution here, and we need 
an optimal solutions for each pair of vectors <strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub> and 
<strong>V</strong><sub>R</sub> (varying system conditions). 
</p>

<p class="jb1"> But don't give up just yet! Because the solutions can be found directly (without 
iterations) &ndash; we just need to use a <em>witty approach</em>. Following are the two 
key steps that unlocked the puzzle.
</p>

<p class="jb1">
First, we abandoned the objective of seeking the solutions in power space 
(i.e., forcing that <em>P</em>=<em>P</em><sub>ref</sub>), and went to find 
viable solutions in the space of line currents (<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub>, 
<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>). 
</p>

<p class="jb1">
And second, we found a geometric interpretation for the constraint of power balance 
(<em>P</em><sub>X</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub>), and based on it were able to 
directly select the currents (<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub>, 
<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>) that meet this condition. 
</p>

<p class="jb1">
With the above two steps combined, it was possible to directly solve for minimum and maximum 
power transfer, and to observe effects of all constraints. Furthermore, we could study collective 
or individual impact of the constraints with virtually no penalty in processing complexity.

<h3 class="jb1"><a name="h-4.1" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Geometric Interpretation of Power Balance
</h3>

<p class="jb1">
The formulation of power balance given by <em>P</em><sub>X</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub> 
is not convenient as it involves both the control (<strong>V</strong><sub>X</sub> and 
<strong>V</strong><sub>Y</sub>) and the controlled variables 
(<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>). 
A formulation of the power balance constraint invariant to changes in 
converter voltages is therefore preferable. Referring to Fig.&nbsp;3(a) the condition 
given by <em>P</em><sub>X</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub> stipulates the 
constant stored energy in the DC capacitor. Furthermore, total energy stored in the 
three&ndash;phase susceptance is, in steady state, constant. Therefore, if losses are neglected, 
condition <em>P</em><sub>X</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub> may be replaced by the
condition <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>. While improved, this formulation 
still does not provide the desired invariance as it depends on voltage vectors 
<strong>V</strong><sub>1</sub> and <strong>V</strong><sub>2</sub>. 
The final formulation is obtained by recognizing that if line segments are 
lossless, <em>P</em><sub>S</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and 
<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>R</sub>. Hence, for a lossless system the condition 
given by <em>P</em><sub>X</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>Y</sub> can be expressed as 
<em>P</em><sub>S</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>R</sub>. The complete transition is recapitulated 
in Fig,&nbsp;3(b).
</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<p class="jb1">
It is advantageous to provide a geometric interpretation for this condition. 
Power is proportional to scalar product of voltage and current. 
Hence, for a given vector <strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub>, sending end power 
<em>P</em><sub>S</sub> is proportional to the projection of <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> 
onto <strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub>. Therefore, as depicted in Fig.&nbsp;4, current vectors 
<strong>I</strong><sub>S1</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>S2</sub> transfer the same 
sending end power, as would any other current vector that has its tip on the same 
line perpendicular to <strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub>. This line may be considered 
a "<em>constant power line</em>".

</table>

<p class="jb1">
Hence, the constant power line gives the loci of solutions for current 
<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> that couple specified value of active power 
<em>P</em><sub>S</sub> from the voltage source <strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub>. 
An analogous constant power line representing solutions for <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> 
can be constructed perpendicular to voltage vector <strong>V</strong><sub>R</sub>. 
The condition of power balance between the converters can hence be expressed 
as the requirement to seek the solutions for vectors <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> 
and <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> that reside on the specified matching pair of 
constant power lines. A pair of constant power lines such that 
<em>P</em><sub>S</sub>=<em>P</em><sub>R</sub> will be called "equal power lines".

Current vectors <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>

degree of freedom in choosing the location for each vector. This degree of freedom 
can be viewed as freedom to select the amount of reactive power supplied from 
the corresponding line end. Specifying <em>Q</em><sub>S</sub> selects a unique

The above procedure can now be used to construct arbitrarily many vector diagrams. 
Some illustrative examples are given in Figs.&nbsp;6&ndash;10. 
</p>
<p class="jb1">
Let us first discuss the operating point that we just found &ndash; we repeated it in 
Fig.&nbsp;6. It corresponds to the power flow lower than the "naturally occurring" 
power flow. Notice that <strong>V</strong><sub>1</sub> and <strong>V</strong><sub>2</sub> 
are positioned in such way as to reduce the angular difference between the voltages 
<strong>V</strong><sub>S</sub> and <strong>V</strong><sub>R</sub>. 
<!--
So instead of having the angle delta pushing the power flow through the line, 
we now have the sum of deltaS and deltaR.

    </tr>
</table>

<p class="jb1"> The diagram in Fig.&nbsp;7 demonstrates a possibility to 
maintain the same line currents for a step changed value of <em>B</em><sub>M</sub>. 
Relative to Fig&nbsp;6, lower value of <em>B</em><sub>M</sub> was used. Now, if 
<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> are to be 
maintained at the same value, <strong>I</strong><sub>M</sub> has to remain the same; 
hence <strong>V</strong><sub>M</sub> must be increased. Fig.&nbsp;7 demonstrates 
that this can be accomplished by reconfiguring the converters' voltages. 
</p>

<p class="jb1"> But, notice another thing here! Any line operating point 
(characterized by a pair of vectors <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and 
<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub>) may have infinitely many "internal operating points". 
Notice that if you can vary <em>B</em><sub>M</sub> smoothly (as you can in an SVC), 
you will have a different triplet of vectors 
(<strong>V</strong><sub>M</sub>, <strong>V</strong><sub>X</sub>, <strong>V</strong><sub>Y</sub>) 
for each value of <em>B</em><sub>M</sub>. This gives rise to <em>optimizing</em> the choice of 
internal operating point. Simply put, if we choose the value for <em>B</em><sub>M</sub> 
intelligently, the converters' voltages can be reduced. Hence, the converters' ratings can be 
reduced, and the whole installation can be made more affordable. We will talk more about 
this later...

<p class="jb1"> In Fig.&nbsp;8 we demonstrate the decoupled control of reactive power supplied 
to the receiving end of the line. Converters' voltages are now configured so as to move 
<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> along its constant power line and reduce the value of 
<em>Q</em><sub>R</sub>. Positions of vectors corresponding to Fig.&nbsp;6 are shown in 
dashed blue lines to help quantify the difference.

    </tr>

<p class="jb1">
Increased power flow is shown in Fig.&nbsp;9. Notice that <strong>V</strong><sub>1</sub> 
is now "below" and <strong>V</strong><sub>2</sub> "above" <strong>V</strong><sub>M</sub> 
&ndash; resulting in the increased combined angle. As expected, the magnitudes of 
<strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> are increased.

<p class="jb1">
Finally, we show the reversal of power flow in Fig.&nbsp;10. Relative position of 
<strong>V</strong><sub>M</sub> and <strong>I</strong><sub>M</sub> indicates 
that <em>B</em><sub>M</sub> is inductive in this case.

<p class="jb1"> The steady state operating points presented by these vector diagrams show 
that the Hybrid Power Flow Controller has the qualitative characteristics of a UPFC. 
Specifically, it can control the flow of active power through the transmission line and 
supply the prescribed amounts of reactive power to sending and receiving segments of the line. 
But, while the UPFC uses a shunt connected converter, the HPFC needs only a shunt connected 
capacitor &ndash; a considerable advantage considering the converter costs. In the next few 
sections we will make a more detailed comparison between these two devices; let us start by 
introducing a framework for this comparison &ndash; the reachable sets.

5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notion of Reachable Sets
</h2>
<p class="jb1"> Recall our discussion in section 3 &ndash; we are selling these things based 
on the premise that they control the flow of power through the transmission line. Let us 
now take a closer look at the problem statement. 
</p>
<!--
<ol class="jbTOC">
<li>We will be looking at some transmission line with known parameters.</li>
<li>We will know the converter ratings that we can afford to install.</li>
<li>So, for a given set of system conditions &ndash; what can this setup do?</li>
</ol>

<p class="jb1">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be looking at some transmission line with known parameters.</p>
<p class="jb1">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;We will know the converter ratings that we can afford to install.</p>
<p class="jb1">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for a given set of system conditions &ndash; what can this setup do?</p>
<p class="jb1">What are all possible solutions for <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub> and 
<strong>I</strong><sub>R</sub> that satisfy all the constraints. We named this set the 
<em>reachable set</em> &ndash; because this is what can be reached "control wise" with the given 
equipment.
</p>
<p class="jb1"> So, once we determine what the reachable currents are &ndash; it is easy 
to map that into the set of values for <em>P</em>, <em>Q</em><sub>1</sub> and 
<em>Q</em><sub>2</sub>. And once we know the reachable sets, we can plot the P&ndash;&delta; 
curves to answer the question of power flow control. 
</p>
<p class="jb1"> This indirect approach of computing the reachable set in current space 
<strong>FIRST</strong> and then mapping it over to the <em>PQQ</em> space is a very 
important contribution of this work. Traditional approaches attempt to compute the 
<em>PQQ</em> set directly using iterations. In contrast, we solve the set of currents 
analytically and then simply map it over to the <em>PQQ</em>. This is shown pictorially 
in Fig.&nbsp;11.

<p class="jb1"> The process for computing reachable sets is discussed in detail 
in the thesis <a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. They are computed in a

are shown and discussed in the next section.

6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The P&ndash;&delta; Curves of the HPFC
</h2>
<p class="jb1"> Consider first the P&ndash;&delta; curves shown in Fig.&nbsp;12. 
It illustrates the range of power flow control for three discrete values 
of <em>B</em><sub>M</sub>: positive, zero and negative. The positive value 
is four times larger than the negative one. Only the converter voltage 
limits were applied in the calculations. </p>

<p class="jb1">Now, for each given value of <em>B</em><sub>M</sub> we can control the 
power flow between the upper and the lower curve, and since the regions overlap, we 
conclude that if we also change BM, we can move from the lowest to the highest curve.

The curves in Fig.&nbsp;13 consider the terminal voltage limits and the converter current
limits. The blue curve is the topmost curve from the previous graph and I
included it here to show how drastic is the change due to the application of limits.
You can notice here that there are no valid solutions at the large values of
transmission angle. This comes from the fact that even if you apply all the
voltage of the converters to oppose the voltage across the line, it still cannot limit
the current and the converters must go into bypass.

6.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison of the HPFC with the UPFC
</h3>
<p class="jb1">
Prior to this work, there was no systematic method available for 
computing the reachable sets of a UPFC installed within the transmission line, while 
respecting equipment and line limits. The formalism developed here for studying the HPFC, 
namely introduction of equal power lines concept, can be successfully applied to solve the
reachable sets of a UPFC. Details of the methodology inclusive of equipment and line limits
are presented in <a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p class="jb1">
The P&ndash;&delta; curves of the HPFC and the P&ndash;&delta; curves of the UPFC are compared in 
Fig&nbsp;17. Curves 1 and 2 correspond to the line controlled by the HPFC to maximize 
and minimize the power flow, respectively; Curve 3 corresponds to the line compensated 
by the underlying SVC; Curve 4 corresponds to the power flow on the uncompensated line; 
Curves 5 and 6 correspond to the line controlled by the UPFC to maximize and minimize the power 
flow, respectively; and curve 7 corresponds to the power flow on the line compensated by 
the underlying STATCOM.

        <td class="jbFigCap">Comparison of P&ndash;&delta curves &ndash; HPFC vs. UPFC </td>

</table>

<p class="jb1">
The performance of the two devices is nearly equivalent for &delta;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;75&deg;. 
At values of &delta;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;75&deg; the UPFC offers somewhat better performance. 
This can be attributed to the fact that the STATCOM is a device superior to the SVC, as 
its ability to supply reactive power does not depend on terminal voltage. 
</p>
<p class="jb1">
Comparison of curves 3 and 7 illustrates this difference projected onto power flow. 
Another factor that contributes to better performance of the UPFC is the fact that it does 
not need to limit the magnitude of current <strong>I</strong><sub>S</sub>. Nonetheless, 
this performance gain comes at a substantially higher price, as the UPFC uses a converter 
in place of an (often existing) SVC or switched capacitor. 
</p>
<p class="jb1">
This example illustrates that the HPFC offers the performance characteristics similar to 
those offered by the UPFC. Furthermore, in many cases the HPFC can be built using two 
identical converter&ndash;transformer subassemblies &ndash; a significant advantage for
practical installations where a spare transformer may be required for redundancy.
