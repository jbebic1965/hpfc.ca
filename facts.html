<h2 class="jb1">Introduction to FACTS</h2>
<p class="jb1">The main purpose of this page is to set the stage for introducing the HPFC through 
the comparison with other, better known, FACTS controllers. To facilitate this comparison we 
review the topologies of the three widely known FACTS controllers, namely the STATCOM, the SSSC, and 
the UPFC. Since all of these controllers are <em>converter based</em>, we start by reviewing the 
basics of the voltage-sourced converters from the perspective of their application in the 
transmission system.
</p>
<p class="jb1">For completeness, however, we also provide some history and a few basic 
definitions. </p>

<p class="jb1">Finally, if you are seeking a comprehensive and authoritative reference in this field, 
we wholeheartedly recommend that you start with the book by N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Hingorani and L.&nbsp;Gyugyi, 
<em>"Understanding&nbsp;FACTS Concepts and Technology of Flexible AC Transmission System"</em>, IEEE 
Press 1999. Alternatively, you can consult an excellent survey 
paper by Dr.&nbsp;Hingorani titled <em>"Flexible ac transmission"</em>, 
published in the April 1993 edition of IEEE Spectrum.

1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just what is "FACTS"?
</h2>
<p class="jb1">According to this Author's research, the acronym <em><strong>FACTS</strong></em> was 
first introduced by Dr.&nbsp;Hingorani, at the joint APC/IEEE luncheon speech on April&nbsp;19,&nbsp;1988 
<a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p class="jbCiteA">
<em>
    Allow me to introduce a new concept of a thyristor-assisted ac power system. I have called this concept 
    "Flexible AC Transmission System" or FACTS. <br>
    ... <br>
    It (the concept of FACTS) is a collection of thyristor based controllers, including phase shifters, 
    advanced static VAR compensator, dynamic brake, modulator series capacitor, load tap changer, 
    fault current limiter, and perhaps other that have yet to be invented. 
</em></p>
<p class="jbCiteB">N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Hingorani 1988&nbsp;<a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a></p>
<p class="jb1">Today, the concept of FACTS includes not only "thyristor based controllers" but all 
"power electronic-based" and other "static controllers". The 1999 definitions are:</p>
<p class="jbCiteA">
<em>
    <strong>Flexibility of Electric Power Transmission:</strong><br>
        The ability to accommodate changes in the electric transmission system or operating 
        conditions while maintaining sufficient steady-state and transient margins.<br><br>
    <strong>Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS):</strong><br>
        Alternating current transmission system incorporating power electronic-based and 
        other static controllers to enhance controllability and increase power transfer 
        capability.<br><br>
    <strong>FACTS Controller:</strong><br>
        A power electronic-based system and other static equipment that provide control of
        one or more AC transmission system parameters.
</em></p>
<p class="jbCiteB">"Understanding FACTS"&nbsp;<a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="jb1">So, speaking in loose terms, the <em>big idea</em> is to connect some fancy 
new equipment to the transmission system and use it to control the flow of power through 
the system. 
</p>

<p class="jb1">That sounds reasonable - why isn't it done already? </p>

<p class="jb1">Well, the technology is relatively new and therein lies the problem. 
First, demonstrated FACTS availability is on order of 99.5%, and that is deemed 
insufficient by many utilities. Then, since the technology is new, it has not been 
fully incorporated into software tools for system planning and dispatching. As a result, 
there isn't yet a straightforward way to build a value story for FACTS.</p>

<p class="jb1"> To build a value story for FACTS we need software tools that would be able to 
select both the optimal types and the optimal locations of FACTS controllers within the 
system, and then compare the investment required with the benefits arising from reduced 
fuel costs, reduced system congestion, reduced emissions, increased utilization of 
renewable sources, increased system security... </p>

<p class="jb1"> Sounds nice? Of course - but we don't have these tools, and it will likely take us 
a while to develop them, and then a while longer to start using them. And meanwhile, <em>poor FACTS 
devices</em> wait for the better times ;) </p>

<p class="jb1"> Well then, with all these impediments, why should anyone think that FACTS 
controllers have the future? It is really quite simple - our transmission infrastructure is 
falling behind our needs, and - whether we like it or not - we will have to get creative. 
</p>

<p class="jbCiteA">
<em>
    In the past, transmission systems were conservatively designed with large stability 
    margins and the then-available dynamic compensators, ... , were rarely required. <br>
    <br>
    In recent years, energy, environment, right-of-way, and cost problems delayed the 
    construction of both generation facilities and new transmission lines. This has 
    necessitated a change in the traditional power system concepts and practices; 
    <strong>better utilization</strong> of existing power systems has become imperative.</em> </p>
<p class="jbCiteB">L.&nbsp;Gyugyi 1988&nbsp;<a class="jbjmpref" href="#ref-3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="jb1">
And it is the emerging field of FACTS that offers the most practical answers for this challenge. 
</p>

<p class="jb1">So, let us go back to the task at hand and look at some of the FACTS controllers 
and the power electronic-based equipment that these controllers are built with...</p>

<p class="jb1">One of the most commonly used power electronic-based building blocks is a voltage-sourced 
converter (VSC). Let us now review the basic concepts of VSCs with respect to their application 
in a transmission system. 
</p>

<p class="jb1"><a class="jbjmp" href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<h2 class="jb1"><a name="h-2" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Basics of Voltage-Sourced Converters
</h2>

<p class="jb1">A basic building block of any voltage-sourced converter (VSC) is the three-phase 
converter bridge. One commonly known configuration for a three-phase bridge is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1. 
The bridge has two DC terminals (indicated by &quot;+&quot; and &quot;&minus;&quot;) 
and three AC terminals (&quot;~&quot;) in the mid points of the converter legs. 
By controlling the states of switches in the legs we can produce arbitrary voltage waveforms 
at the AC terminals.
</p>

<p class="jbCen"><img class="jbFigImg" src="images/vsc_basics_1.gif" alt="three-phase converter bridge"></p>
<table class="jbInd">
    <tr>
        <td class="jbFigNo">Fig.&nbsp;1</td>
        <td class="jbFigCap">A three-phase converter bridge - the basic building block of a VSC</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p class="jb1">Now, when a VSC is interfaced to a transmission system it has to: (i) operate at the 
line frequency, and (ii) produce a balanced set of sinusoidal voltages. Therefore, a VSC coupled to 
the transmission system has only <strong>two control degrees of freedom</strong> - it can vary the magnitude 
and the phase angle of its output voltage relative to the system voltage.</p>

<p class="jb1">These two control degrees of freedom can be mapped into freedom to exchange active 
and reactive power with the transmission system. The amount of exchanged reactive power is limited 
only by the current capacity of the converter switches, while the active power coupled to (from) the 
line has to be supplied from (delivered to) the DC terminals, as shown symbolically in Fig.&nbsp;2.
</p>

<p class="jbCen"><img class="jbFigImg" src="images/vsc_basics_2.gif" alt="P, Q exchange VSC/transmission line"></p>

        <td class="jbFigNo">Fig.&nbsp;2</td>
        <td class="jbFigCap">A VSC interfaced to a transmission line - P, Q exchange</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p class="jb1">Let us now look at the three exemplary FACTS controllers.</p>

<p class="jb1"><a class="jbjmp" href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<h2 class="jb1"><a name="h-3" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;STATic COMpensator (STATCOM)
</h2>
<p class="jb1">The STATic COMpensator (STATCOM) uses a VSC interfaced in shunt to a transmission line. 
In most cases the DC voltage support for the VSC will be provided by the DC capacitor of relatively 
small energy storage capability - hence, in steady state operation, active power exchanged with 
the line has to be maintained at zero, as shown symbolically in Fig.&nbsp;3. </p>
<p class="jbCen"><img class="jbFigImg" src="images/statcom.gif" alt="STATCOM - topology"></p>
<table class="jbInd">
    <tr>
        <td class="jbFigNo">Fig.&nbsp;3</td>
        <td class="jbFigCap"><strong>STATCOM</strong> - A VSC interfaced in shunt to a transmission line</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="jb1">
With the active power constraint imposed, the control of the STATCOM is reduced to one 
degree of freedom, which is used to control the amount of reactive power exchanged with 
the line. Accordingly, a STATCOM is operated as a functional equivalent of a static 
VAR compensator; it provides faster control than an SVC and improved control range.
</p>

<p class="jb1"><a class="jbjmp" href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<h2 class="jb1"><a name="h-4" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC)
</h2>
<p class="jb1">The Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) uses a VSC interfaced in series 
to a transmission line, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. 
</p>
<p class="jbCen"><img class="jbFigImg" src="images/sssc.gif" alt="SSSC - topology"></p>
<table class="jbInd">
    <tr>
        <td class="jbFigNo">Fig.&nbsp;4</td>
        <td class="jbFigCap"><strong>SSSC</strong> - A VSC interfaced in series to a transmission line</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="jb1"> Again, the active power exchanged with the line has to be maintained at 
zero - hence, in steady state operation, SSSC is a functional equivalent of an infinitely 
variable series connected capacitor. The SSSC offers fast control and it is inherently neutral 
to sub-synchronous resonance. 
</p>

<h2 class="jb1"><a name="h-5" title="go back to this item in TOC" href="#toc-5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC)
</h2>
<p class="jb1">The Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) combines the above two compensators 
into one. The DC terminals of the two underlying VSCs are now coupled, and this creates a path 
for active power exchange between the converters. Hence, the active power supplied to the 
line by the series converter, can now be supplied by the shunt converter, as shown 
in Fig.&nbsp;5. 
<!-- Hence, the series converter can now inject a voltage vector in an arbitrary direction 
relative to the line current vector. 
-->
</p>
<p class="jbCen"><img class="jbFigImg" src="images/upfc.gif" alt="UPFC - topology"></p>
<table class="jbInd">
    <tr>
        <td class="jbFigNo">Fig.&nbsp;5</td>
        <td class="jbFigCap"><strong>UPFC</strong> - Coupling of converters' DC terminals 
        offers a fundamentally different range of control options</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p class="jb1">This topology offers three degrees of freedom, or more precisely - four 
degrees of freedom (two associated with each VSC) with one constraint (active powers 
of the VSCs must match). Therefore, a fundamentally different range of control options 
is available compared to STATCOM or SSSC. The UPFC can be used to control the flow of 
active and reactive power through the line and to control the amount of reactive power 
supplied to the line at the point of installation.
</p>
<p class="jb1">Perhaps the only downside of this topology is that it is entirely 
converter based, i.e., it uses the converters to supply both active and reactive power. 
Let us explain...
</p>
<p class="jb1">For efficient operation transmission systems need distributed reactive 
power support. This is commonly accomplished by installing banks of capacitance at strategic 
locations within the system, and by switching these banks in and out as needed. 
The UPFC can make limited use of such hardware; by definition it uses the shunt converter 
to supply the active power coupled by the series converter, and once the shunt converter 
is in place it is also used to supply all of the needed reactive power.
</p>
<p class="jb1">Conceptually, this feature seems advantageous as we are now getting &quot;the 
free STATCOM&quot; to supply the reactive power - the reality however is that this STATCOM is 
NOT FREE after all! In fact, in cases where the reactive power support exists, an argument could 
be made that by requiring the STATCOM we are forcing the owner to decommission a 
&quot;perfectly good&quot; battery of shunt capacitors, and that is not the kind of 
news many owners like to hear.
</p>
<!--
<p class="jb1">Our proposed new controller, the HPFC, uses two equally rated voltage-sourced 
converters to upgrade the functionality of the existing switched capacitors or static VAR 
compensators. By using appropriate converter control this functionality can be changed from 
reactive power support to the generalized power flow control - the functionality commonly 
associated with the UPFC. The key benefit of the new topology is that it fully utilizes 
existing equipment and thereby the required ratings of the additional converters are 
substantially lower than the ratings of the comparable UPFC.
</p>

<p class="jb1">Our proposed new controller, the HPFC, offers performance characteristics
